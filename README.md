# People's Transit Alliance

Let's join together to fight for fare-free, 0 emission, expanded public transit
in the San Francisco Bay Area... and beyond!


## Get started

* macOS: `brew install hugo`

* Ubuntu Linux: `snap install hugo --channel=extended`

* [Install](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) a reasonably recent version of
  Node.js / NPM (to get the `npx` command), if not already installed


## Spin-up local development

- Start hugo: `hugo server`

- Develop admin panel locally: `npx netlify-cms-proxy-server` (in a separate
  terminal)

- Build project:
    - Checkout the project and run the following command from the
      root project folder:  `hugo`
