    ### Hey MTC! Stop Starving Our Transit! Unlock Our Transit Money Now!

    On March 11, President Biden signed a $1.9 trillion rescue bill, sending
    $1.7 billion to the Bay Area for transit. This money is intended to create
    union jobs and to provide services vital to working people’s daily lives.
    The time to do that is now, as working families struggle to recover from
    the health and economic impacts of the global pandemic.

    With all that money, why are Bay Area transit agencies adopting austerity
    budgets for the fiscal year that begins July 1? Because the regional board
    that allocates each transit agency’s share of funding -- the Metropolitan
    Transportation Commission (MTC) -- has it locked up. Instead of dealing
    with today’s crisis, MTC wants to put off spending money for a future date.
    It made that decision in private discussions with transit agency
    management, from which the workers and riders on the frontlines of the
    crisis were excluded.

    Labor, riders and the community will rally at the Transbay Terminal and
    march to MTC headquarters to demand that MTC unlock the transit funds now.
    If this money is not spent to quickly restore service as the Bay Area
    re-opens, public transportation in the Bay Area will suffer a long-term
    decline. The time to act is NOW! Join us at this rally to demand that MTC
    unlocks our transit money now!
