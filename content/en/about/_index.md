AC Transit is a vital public good for the East Bay's working class. In the
1950s, the working people of the East Bay fought to create the AC Transit
system, taking our bus system out of the hands of a private, for-profit
corporation. AC Transit's riders skew lower-income than those who take other
forms of public transit, and 75% are People of Color. Bus service is essential
to connecting its diverse riders to jobs, schools, healthcare, and grocery
stores - while taking cars off the streets and keeping carbon out of the
atmosphere.

Now, amid a pandemic and economic depression, our public bus system is in grave
danger. Service cuts, layoffs, and a return to rising fares would be
devastating to those who depend on the bus service. AC Transit is a necessity
for the most vulnerable members of the working class - including students, the
elderly, and the disabled. That makes public transit a social justice issue.
That's why we are fighting to defend and expand public transit, to ensure it as
a right for all. We must fight for expanded, fare-free service and a rapid
transition to a zero-emission fleet, funded by taxes on corporations and the
super-rich, to put our transit system at the center of a green economic
recovery.

Our campaign:

* Will fight for safe working conditions for transit workers;

* Will fight to protect Black lives, starting with our workers and riders;

* Will bring the East Bay together to keep AC Transit fare-free and to stop the
  dangerous cuts being proposed to our bus service;

* Will demand that the super-rich and corporations pay their fair share in
  taxes, to save public transportation from austerity and privatization and to
  fund a Green New Deal for public transportation in the East Bay.
