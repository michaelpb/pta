### **Overview**

We are currently running two active campaigns and are in the research and development stages of one campaign:

* **Active - Rider’s Budget - We’re demanding that AC Transit spends the federal stimulus funds on priorities that benefits riders and workers**
* **Active - Hazard Pay - We support Bay Area transit workers in their demand for hazard pay**
* R&D - Fare-Free Transit - We demand that no person has to pay fares to access public transit

### **A Rider's Budget**

**The what and why**

The COVID pandemic brought our public bus system to the brink of collapse. Many routes and service hours that were cut still have not been restored. Ridership has dwindled due to infrequent service and high fares. Exacerbating the issue, AC Transit’s hiring freeze over the pandemic has resulted in a transit worker shortage requiring rapid hiring and training in order to even have enough drivers to bring bus service back to pre-pandemic levels. 

Fortunately, over $110 million in federal rescue funds is on the way to AC Transit– the transit agency has already received $66 million, and will receive another $44 million this fiscal year. This money is intended to restore public transit. However, AC Transit is not taking the rapid action required to spend these funds and to get transit back up and running. It is instead keeping the money in the bank for future budget shortfalls.

This is why riders and transit workers demand that:

* AC Transit must spend the first $66 million now to hire and train transit workers, restore service including paratransit, reduce fares and provide [hazard pay to the frontline transit workers](https://eastbaymajority.com/ac-transit-jovanka-beckles-covid-hazard-pay-bus-drivers/) who kept AC Transit moving throughout the pandemic. 
* AC Transit must make a plan for the next $44 million now, in public meetings that give transit workers and riders a democratic say in how and when those tens of millions of dollars are spent.

**What we’re doing**

At the People’s Transit Alliance, we are organizing regular canvassing events where we are talking to riders about these priorities and listening to their experiences both before and during the pandemic. We are developing various ways that riders can mobilize and demand a transit system that truly serves the riders and workers. We want to support the development of a class consciousness of riders.

### **Fare-Free**

**What it is**

Fare-free transit is a system which does not require passengers to pay a fare to ride. A fully implemented fare-free transit system would abolish fare for all users at all times. Some cities have carried out partial fare-free transit systems, waiving fees for certain users such as seniors, students or low-income riders. There are both national and international examples of fully fare-free systems and the movement is building throughout many large US cities such as Los Angeles and Boston.

**Why**

A fare-free transit system would encourage community members to use public transportation more often, increasing livability metrics. Growth of ridership could mean a decrease in street congestion, a problem that has been plaguing the Bay Area for years. Fare-free would also be instrumental in helping low-income communities as 65% of AC Transit’s riders come from households earning less than $50,000 a year. By removing fees from our transit system, we can ensure that everyone has the ability to access their needs efficiently.

Fare-free in short:

* Places transit in the same category of public services as schools, libraries, community parks, firefighting and police services
* Increases city vibrancy and livability
* Democratizes the service, making it equally available to everyone regardless of income, to use as often as they like
* Increases ridership and decreases street congestion, accidents and pollution
* Leads to service expansion that in turn leads a more frequent and reliable system as well good union jobs

**What we’re doing**

At People's Transit Alliance, we're engaging in many activities to make fare-free a possibility at AC Transit. We are currently researching existing fare-free systems, possible funding sources, and new ways to imagine safety onboard. We are also engaging with transit workers to understand how a fare-free system might impact them and researching solutions to any adverse effects. 

### **Past Campaigns and Actions**

When the federal stimulus funds were announced in March 2021 and the Bay Area Metropolitan Transit Commission (MTC) began to imply that they were thinking to save these funds for a "rainy" day instead of distributing it the Bay Area transit agency for much needed pandemic revoery support, we began pressuring the commission through a variety of tactics.

We wrote an article that shared the stakes at play, you can find that [here](https://eastbaymajority.com/bay-area-transit-stimulus-bailout-arp-mtc-ac-transit/).

Our efforts culimated in a rally on May 6th, you can find the documentation from [here](https://peoplestransit.org/c/hey-mtc-rally/).
