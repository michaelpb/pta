### **Overview**

We are currently running two active campaigns and are in the research and development stages of one campaign:

* **Active - Rider’s Budget - We’re demanding that AC Transit spends the federal stimulus funds on priorities that benefits riders and workers**
* **Active - Hazard Pay - We support Bay Area transit workers in their demand for hazard pay**
* R&D - Fare-Free Transit - We demand that no person has to pay fares to access public transit

### **A Rider's Budget**

{{< youtube id="A0k0UQmN364">}}

The COVID pandemic brought our public bus system to the brink of collapse. Many routes and service hours that were cut still have not been restored. Ridership has dwindled due to infrequent service and high fares. Exacerbating the issue, AC Transit’s hiring freeze over the pandemic has resulted in a transit worker shortage requiring rapid hiring and training in order to even have enough drivers to bring bus service back to pre-pandemic levels. 

Fortunately, over $110 million in federal rescue funds is on the way to AC Transit– the transit agency has already received $66 million, and will receive another $44 million this fiscal year. This money is intended to restore public transit and yet AC Transit is not taking the rapid action required to spend these funds in order to get transit back up and running. AC Transit has instead been implying that they may keep the money in the bank for future budget shortfalls.

This is why riders and transit workers demand that:

* AC Transit spend the first $66 million now to hire and train transit workers, restore service including paratransit, reduce fares and provide [hazard pay to the frontline transit workers](https://eastbaymajority.com/ac-transit-jovanka-beckles-covid-hazard-pay-bus-drivers/) who kept AC Transit moving throughout the pandemic. 
* AC Transit make a plan for the next $44 million now, in public meetings that give transit workers and riders a democratic say in how and when those tens of millions of dollars are spent.

**What we’re doing**

At the People’s Transit Alliance, we are organizing regular canvassing events where we are talking to riders about these priorities and listening to their experiences both before and during the pandemic. We are developing various ways that riders can mobilize and demand a transit system that truly serves riders and workers. We ultimately want to support the development of a class consciousness of riders that has the power to demand and fight for a transit system that meets their needs.

### **Hazard Pay Now**

Transit workers cannot work from home. Since the first outbreak of COVID-19 in March 2020, front-line workers for transit agencies in the Bay Area have risked their health and safety to keep our cities moving. They have worked under constant fear of getting sick, and many have had to severely limit - or completely eliminate - time spent with children, grandchildren, family members and friends due to the risk of spreading COVID-19. In addition, front-line transit workers, like all essential workforces in the Bay Area, are disproportionately POC, and are therefore already more vulnerable to getting sick and dying from the virus. While Black workers make up only 6% of the Bay Area’s essential workers, they make up [23% of all transit workers in the region](https://sff.org/bay-areas-essential-workers-are-disproportionately-people-of-color-women-and-immigrants-new-study-finds/).  

**Why Transit Workers Deserve Hazard Pay**

Transit workers are often referred to as front-line essential workers, who provide a critical service for our cities and metropolitan regions. During the pandemic, this was even more evident, as the continuity of transit service was necessary to meet the needs of riders who used transit services to access health services, work sites, grocery stores and other essential places throughout the pandemic.

As transit in our region begins to expand back to pre-pandemic levels, we must center the roles of front-line transit staff. Providing hazard pay is a necessary action to compensate transit workers for the physical and emotional trauma of working during the pandemic. Despite the praise that transit workers have received, there has yet to be any material benefit for their sacrifices during COVID-19 for these workforces among any of the major Bay Area transit agencies.  This is why transit workers around the Bay Area are making their voices heard and demanding that they receive retroactive hazard pay from their employers. 

**What we’re doing**

The People’s Transit Alliance stands in solidarity with transit workers demanding retroactive hazard pay. We have been supporting local chapters of the Amalgamated Transit Union, Local 192 and 265 by capturing the stories of individual workers and raising awareness of this campaign. By listening to their demands, discussing and assisting with the development of targeted strategies including the organization of rallies, we hope to win this campaign and get hazard pay for transit workers around the Bay.

### **Fare-Free**

Fare-free transit is a system which does not require passengers to pay a fare to ride. A fully implemented fare-free transit system would abolish fare for all users at all times. Some cities have carried out partial fare-free transit systems, waiving fees for certain users such as seniors, students or low-income riders. There are both national and international examples of fully fare-free systems and the movement is building throughout many large US cities such as Los Angeles and Boston.

A fare-free transit system would encourage community members to use public transportation more often, increasing livability metrics. Growth of ridership could mean a decrease in street congestion, a problem that has been plaguing the Bay Area for years. Fare-free would also be instrumental in helping low-income communities as 65% of AC Transit’s riders come from households earning less than $50,000 a year. By removing fees from our transit system, we can ensure that everyone has the ability to access their needs efficiently.

Fare-free in short:

* Places transit in the same category of public services as schools, libraries, community parks, firefighting and police services
* Increases city vibrancy and livability
* Democratizes the service, making it equally available to everyone regardless of income, to use as often as they like
* Increases ridership and decreases street congestion, accidents and pollution
* Leads to service expansion that in turn leads a more frequent and reliable system as well good union jobs

**What we’re doing**

At People's Transit Alliance, we're engaging in many activities to make fare-free a possibility at AC Transit. We are currently researching existing fare-free systems, possible funding sources, and new ways to imagine safety onboard. We are also engaging with transit workers to understand how a fare-free system might impact them and researching solutions to any adverse effects. 

### **Past Campaigns and Actions**

Federal stimulus funds were received March 2021 with the intention to support transit agencies in recovering from the toll of the pandemic. The Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC) delayed the distribution of this lifeline for months, implying they might save these funds for an unknown "rainy" day and not recognizing the "rainy" day was now. We began pressuring the commission through a variety of tactics including watchdogging meetings, running a communications campaign and mobilizing a coalition of transit advocates.

Our efforts culminated in a rally on May 6th, you can the documentation of it [here](https://peoplestransit.org/c/hey-mtc-rally/).

This [a](https://eastbaymajority.com/bay-area-transit-stimulus-bailout-arp-mtc-ac-transit/)rticle we wrote shares more context on MTC's delay and it's implications.
