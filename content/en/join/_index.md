### **Learn More**

If you’re interested in keeping tabs on our work or hearing about upcoming events, email pta@eastbaydsa.org or follow us on twitter [@peopletransit](https://twitter.com/PeopleTransit)

### **Upcoming Events**

**September 2025 Canvassing**

The People's Transit Alliance (PTA) is launching a Fix Our Schedules campaign to push for predictable and realistic schedules that ensure drivers get their breaks and riders get reliable service. Supporting ATU 192, we're demanding better schedules and better bus service in low-income areas.

Over the next month, we'll be doing poster canvasses in the East Bay to help get out the word about supporting AC Transit drivers. We'll be distributing posters to businesses to place posters in their storefronts so drivers feel community support.

**Transit Month - Fix Our Schedules! How AC Transit Worker-Rider Solidarity Results in Better Service**

Join us for an evening of transit driver and rider solidarity. Dinner will be provided to facilitate mixing and mingling with fellow advocates, followed by a short panel discussion to learn about how we can advocate for improved transit schedules for AC Transit operators and ATU 192 members. Better schedules for transit workers means more reliable service for transit riders. We will have opportunities for workers, riders, and advocates to plug into an existing campaign to improve AC Transit service!

**Fall AC Transit Meetings**

Save the date to show up to the September 24th and October 22nd AC Transit Board Meetings at 5pm in Downtown Oakland. 

### **Volunteer**

PTA is entirely volunteer-run. This means we need you, a volunteer, to join! In particular, we are in need of these roles:

* **Canvassers** - Related to the Fix Our Schedules campaign, you can participate by talking to riders about this demand.
* **Communications** - We publish articles, design graphics, maintain a Twitter feed, and make memes.
* **Librarian/archivist/informationalist** - As we develop and execute campaigns we develop a lot of useful tools and information that needs to be archived in ways that are legible and accessible to existing and new members and eventually become frameworks for other organizers. 
* **Members coordinator** - Someone who keeps an eye out for our existing members and supports new members. This could include doing  1:1s with interested new members, check-ins with existing members, coordinating socials, and sharing PTA updates.
* **Watchdogging** - We attend AC Transit meetings every other Wednesday evening and give public comment on important agenda items. Our work would always benefit from having more voices at these meetings! The Tuesday before a meeting we review the agenda together, discuss the issues and have a lively chat during the meetings themselves. We also occasionally attend MTC (Metropolitan Transit Commission) meetings and give public comments.
* **Fare-free researchers and proposal writers** - This campaign is currently on pause, but we welcome anyone interested in seeing AC Transit go fare-free.
* **Reimagining Public Safety** - This campaign is also currently on pause, but was inspired by ACT-LA's publication [Metro as Sanctuary](http://allianceforcommunitytransit.org/metro-as-a-sanctuary/) and we were researching alternatives to policing that provide safer transit experiences for workers and riders. Again, we would still love to hear from anyone interested in this campaign!

With that being said, you don’t need any particular skills or even more than a few hours to be a huge help to our movement. Power flows from the people, so get involved! We strive to actively mentor. Email us at [pta@eastbaydsa.org](mailto:pta@eastbaydsa.org) if you are interested.

### **Share Thoughts**

We are always interested in hearing from riders and transit union members, feel free to email us at pta@eastbaydsa.org and share any thoughts that could inform our organizing. We’re a small, volunteer-run organization so we may not always get a chance to respond, but we read and appreciate your thoughts.

If you take the time to email us, let us know what mode of transportation you use and what lines. If you are a union member, let us know what union you belong to.
