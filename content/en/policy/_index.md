### Overview



We are currently in the research and development phases of three campaigns:



* Transit Recovery - We demand that public transit service is restored to pre-pandemic levels
* Fare-Free Transit - We demand that no person has to pay fares to access public transit
* Zero-Emission Buses - We demand that AC Transit workers are given adequate resources and support as the agency transition to zero-emission buses 

### Transit Recovery



When the pandemic began in spring of 2020, AC Transit drastically reduced service assuming that less passengers were boarding. This combined with the necessary safety precaution of limiting carrying capacity so 6’ of social distancing can be maintained, has meant that many passengers are being passed up and can no longer depend on public transportation to make it to work, doctors appointments or access amenities. 



The very future of public transportation itself is at risk if service is not restored. Passengers find new solutions to get to where they need to go and never return. Transit workers are skilled employees, who require years of training; when they are laid off, rehiring can take years. Service before the pandemic was already at such a dire state that public transportation was considered infrequent, unreliable and unappealing leading to poor public opinion. When agencies cut service, transit never recovers from the downward spiral. 



Transit recovery in short:

* Allows individuals to rely on public transportation
* Preserves the future of public transportation
* Contributes to job creation significantly more than other transportation programs



At PTA, we’re building a coalition with the transit unions of a number of agencies in order to unify in our demand to restore service. 

### Fare-Free



Fare-free transit is a system which does not require passengers to pay a fare to ride. A fully implemented fare-free transit system would abolish fare for all users at all times. Some cities have carried out partial fare-free transit systems, waiving fees for certain users such as seniors, students or low-income riders. There are both national and international examples of fully fare-free systems and the movement is building throughout many large US cities such as Los Angeles and Boston.



A fare-free transit system would encourage community members to use public transportation more often, increasing livability metrics. Growth of ridership could mean a decrease in street congestion, a problem that has been plaguing the Bay Area for years. Fare-free would also be instrumental in helping low-income communities as 65% of AC Transit’s riders come from households earning less than $50,000 a year. By removing fees from our transit system, we can ensure that everyone has the ability to access their needs efficiently.



Fare-free in short:



* Places transit in the same category of public services as schools, libraries, community parks, firefighting and police services
* Increases city vibrancy and livability
* Democratizes the service, making it equally available to everyone regardless of income, to use as often as they like
* Increases ridership and decreases street congestion, accidents and pollution
* Leads to service expansion that in turn leads a more frequent and reliable system as well good union jobs



At PTA, we are engaging in many activities to make fare-free a possibility at AC Transit. We are currently researching existing fare-free systems, possible funding sources, and new ways to imagine safety onboard. We are also engaging with transit workers to understand how a fare-free system might impact them and researching solutions to any adverse effects. 

### Zero-Emission Buses



AC Transit has been a leader in the transition to zero-emission busses by currently having 23 hydrogen powered busses and 7 battery electric busses of its 635 fleet, with plans to replace all diesel busses by 2040. The transition to zero-emission busses by 2040 would positively impact the health of California residents, avoiding tens of thousands of asthma attacks, among other medical issues caused by pollution. Heavy duty busses and trucks make up only 7% of California’s roads, but contribute about 20% of carbon emissions within the state.  



AT PTA, we want to ensure that AC Transit stays on track to complete the given timeline and provides workers with safe working conditions and resources in this process. AC Transit is failing ATU 192 workers in providing adequate training, access to safety gear and safe working conditions. We stand by ATU 192 workers in these demands and are currently working on an article that addresses these demands in detail.
