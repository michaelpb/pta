Our campaign

* Will fight for safe working conditions for transit workers;

* Will fight to protect Black lives, starting with our workers and riders;

* Will bring the East Bay together to keep AC Transit fare-free and to stop the
  dangerous cuts being proposed to our bus service;

* Will demand that the super-rich and corporations pay their fair share in
  taxes, to save public transportation from austerity and privatization and to
  fund a Green New Deal for public transportation in the East Bay.
