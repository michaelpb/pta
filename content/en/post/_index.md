# Transit Corridor Bulletin

<!--StartFragment-->

We write a quarterly bulletin to inform our community about the politics of public transportation with an emphasis on how it affects the Bay Area. 

A critical tool in this fight is an understanding and analysis of how the contemporary state of public transportation does not serve working people. From deep dives into the the agencies that fund and plan our transportation system to analyses of funding, urban development, and operations, we intend to shed light on the obscure, abstract, and complicated aspects of public transportation. In so doing, we intend to build power to put pressure on transit systems and transform them into we know to be our right: comprehensive, accessible, reliable, equitable, and efficient public transportation systems.
 
We hope that providing consistent coverage we are able to help equip riders, organizers, and workers with a resource to lean on for deciphering and participating in the fight for public transportation. Knowledge is power, and people can't build power without it.
