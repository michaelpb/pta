## Knowledge is power, and people can't build power without it.

<!--StartFragment-->

In this library, we share articles we've written, political education sessions we've developed, and informative resources we've come across.

A critical tool in this fight is an understanding and analysis of how the contemporary state of public transportation does not serve working people. From deep dives into the agencies that fund and plan our transportation system to analyses of funding, urban development, and operations, we intend to shed light on the obscure, abstract, and complicated aspects of public transportation. In so doing, we intend to build power to put pressure on transit systems and transform them into we know to be our right: comprehensive, accessible, reliable, equitable, and efficient public transportation systems.

We hope that providing consistent coverage and political education we are able to help equip riders, organizers, and workers with resources to lean on for deciphering and participating in the fight for public transportation.
