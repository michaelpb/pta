In this political education session we asked: what is public about public transportation in contemporary times? We worked through several questions as a group, including how public services intersect with capitalism and the history of the transition from private to public ownership for transit in the East Bay.

It was an open forum around a handful of topics, the presentation can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1drDjnxeklSEVproz9JBw8WdmrtTUZtea-ZN7l-RTEFA/edit#slide=id.gefada1e6d3_0_2) and some items that came up in the discussion can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c-QI7eXoQbQUeuZOa7uRyxTJG1Tprpm3pxhIWV1urY8/edit#).
