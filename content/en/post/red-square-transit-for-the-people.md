The People’s Transit Alliance and the Political Education Committee of the East Bay DSA hosted this Night School to discuss how public transportation is an important site for socialist organizing. From public transit’s role as a unionized labor sector to its crucial position as a tool in the fight for ecosocialism and collective struggle, it’s clear that the stakes of how we move around where we live are high.\
\
We reflected on transportation’s role in capitalism and how it might be transformed, important moments in socialist history that engage transit, and a few possible angles for organizing class struggle and winning a transit system that exists for and through the working class.
